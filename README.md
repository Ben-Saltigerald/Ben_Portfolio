Compilation of projects that I have created 

# [Project 1: UFO Sightings â€” Data Query: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/PythonEmailExtractor)
Queried data from a csv file that includes records of UFO sightings across the world. I decided to filter the data to obtain information about sightings in every city that I have ever lived in. 

- Imported the file and read it into a dictionary
- Filtered the data to look for sightings that inlcuded bright objects.
- Filtered the data by every city I have lived in obtained the average duration that each of these sightings lasted in each city.

# [Project 2: Email Extractor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/PythonEmailExtractor)

- Created a tool that extracts all sender email addresses from a txt file and counts the number of addresses that are extracted 
- Prompts for a file name, opens the file, reads through the file 
- Loops through the file and identifies and parses all sender addresses and ignores all receiver addresses

# [Project 3: Shopping List: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/Shopping-List.git)
I have created a grocery shopping list to make planning my grocery shopping a little more conveinent. 
This list includes the following: 

- A display of common items that I include in my grocery shopping are displayed along with a number next to each item (1-18). Items can be selected form this list by inputting their corresponding item number.
- Items may also be added to the list if there are any additional items needed that are not included in the list of common items. 
- Once the list has been selected, the user is prompted to select the quantity for each item. 
- The final list of items is displayed along with the quantity of each item. 

# [Project 4: Number Properties: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/NumberProperties.git)
For this project I have written code in Python to identify different types of number properties. The user simply enters a number between 1 and 10,000 and what is returned are the specific number properties that the number belongs to.

The following number properties are identified:

- Factor - A factor is a number that divides evenly into another number
- Prime Number - A number with exactly 2 factors -- 1 and itself
- Composite Number - A number with more than 2 factors
- Perfect Number - A number is said to be perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its factors
- Abundant Number- The sum of its factors (aside from the number) is greater than the number itself
- Triangular Number - The triangular number Tn is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangular grid of points where the first row contains a single element and each subsequent row contains one more element than the previous one
- Narcissistic Number - A positive integer is called narcissistic if it is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits
