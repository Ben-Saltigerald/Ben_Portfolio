Compilation of projects that I have created 

# [Project 1: Python Email Extractor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/PythonEmailExtractor)

- Created a tool that extracts all sender email addresses from a txt file and counts the number of addresses that are extracted 
- Prompts for a file name, opens the file, reads through the file 
- Loops through the file and identifies and parses all sender addresses and ignores all receiver addresses

# [Project 2: Python Number Properties: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/NumberProperties.git)
For this assignment I have written code in Python to identify different types of number properties. The user simply enters a number between 1 and 10,000 and what is returned are the specific number properties that the number belongs to.

The following number properties are identified:

Factor - A factor is a number that divides evenly into another number
Prime Number - A number with exactly 2 factors -- 1 and itself
Composite Number - A number with more than 2 factors
Perfect Number - A number is said to be perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its factors
Abundant Number- The sum of its factors (aside from the number) is greater than the number itself
Triangular Number - The triangular number Tn is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangular grid of points where the first row contains a single element and each subsequent row contains one more element than the previous one
Narcissistic Number - A positive integer is called narcissistic if it is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits
