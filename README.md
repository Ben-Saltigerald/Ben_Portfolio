# [Project 1: Python Email Extractor: Project Overview] (github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/PythonEmailExtractor/tree/main/email_extractor)

- Created a tool that extracts all sender email addresses from a txt file and counts the number of addresses that are extracted 
- Prompts for a file name, opens the file, reads through the file 
- Loops through the file and identifies and parses all sender addresses and ignores all receiver addresses
